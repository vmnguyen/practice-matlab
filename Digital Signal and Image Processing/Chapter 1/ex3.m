% Implicit enumaration
% In this ex, we'll define a matrix with 1 element and have 10 devisions
% There are 2 ways to define that matrix
% a = (0:1:10) or a = (0:10)
% a = (intD: step: intF)
% These expression above refer to a list of values starting at intD,...
% and going up to intF value by increments of step
% The increment value step can be ommited if it is equal to 1
a = (0:1:10) % same with a = (0:10)
